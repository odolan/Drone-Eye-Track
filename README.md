# Drone-Eye-Track

This project uses pretrained facial landmarks to determine the users right eye. Using the calculated zone, the program applies the open-cv hough circle detector to look for the individuals pupil. 


This Program uses the DJI Tello module along with openCV to track a human pupil using a camera and to translate eye movements into movements of the drone
